<p>People have been using online shopping for buying a lot of stuffs such as foods, games, and cars these days because they are afraid to go outside to infect the COVID-19, or many stores are temporality closed right now. As you can see, online shopping is getting more popular and very easy to operate to see the prices and merchandise. In my opinion, it would be a great idea everyone can use online shopping regardless of ages or sexes because if it's not very easy to operate, many people may struggle to choose stuff, and they don't want to use complicated websites anymore. Therefore, web designers and developers are always updating and seeking to create more straightforward and convenient websites for customers. However, I think it would be challenging to make simpler and more convenient websites than other company's websites. For example, Amazon and eBay are one of the best online shopping I've ever used because it's simple to use, display big images, and can see other people's reviews. That's because I think they're very famous for continuing for a long time. As a result, many people would give up make better websites; on the other hand, I didn't know that there are a large number of creating new online shopping platforms that I found. According to the article, "The Best 13 Platforms to Build an eCommerce Website in 2019" written by Emma Roth said that, "All good eCommerce platforms let you build your online store from the ground up, starting with store design. But if it's your first time building an online store, you'll want something with an easy-to-use interface." He also mentioned that all you have to do is setting a goal of making easy to use websites. Therefore, the eCommerce website would be very helpful to create it. I'm not sure which platforms are useful for making the website, but I would choose Wix.com because I have watched many advertisements on YouTube, and it looks very flexible to adjust the new website.
In contrast, many people think that how to start to make the new online shopping website, but "How to find an Online Shopping Cart and start an Online Business" believed that "In general we would recommend that you get started with the designs available from eCorner. These are very flexible and you can change colours, add logos and banners." I've never heard of that eCorner before, but it's connected with eBay, so it would be more reliable to use it.
