<p>Recently, many developers and web designers are focusing on creating high-quality websites, which include high-quality images, as more and more people are finding the latest articles these days because of COVID-19 pandemics. As you can see, all of the world situation has changed on an hour by hour basis, and many people are seeking to find easy to read and see it as soon as possible. Also, I think people distinguish to check high-quality images unconsciously on the websites as well. If it’s not the beautiful color of pictures, most of the people would deny seeing the websites, as a large number of people who believe that the high-quality websites means the latest article. Therefore, when web designers and developers are making new websites for customers, they are always trying to find high-quality images on the websites. However, if you put too many high-quality images on your website, it could be a lot of faults that you would find. According to the importance of keeping file sizes of your images small, “Big graphics make your pages load too slowly. This in turn forces your visitors to leave and no-one sees your website anyway. You have now lost your chance to make money!” I think this article is accurate because I put a lot of high-quality images on my website for creating beautiful websites when I made a website the first time. However, it went so slowly at last because I didn’t even think about the image volume. I realized that if it’s excessive images on my website, it could be very inconvenient for customers eventually. Therefore, when I’m going to make a website next time, I’ll be careful to consider how much will spend the image volumes.
However, in my opinion, it’s tough to find theme images on my website. When I made websites, I always wanted to put images in my background to create a good impression for the customers, but websites are huge screens for one image, so many images become blocky and difficult to put on my website. Thus, sometimes I was trying to find high-quality images rather than theme images. Nevertheless, the importance of high-quality images on your website said, “Although many aspects of an image affect its quality, the three most important factors for website images are sharpness, relevance, and speed. Applying these standards to your website images can enhance your site’s user experience, its prominence in search engine results, and its ability to turn visitors into leads and customers. (Beach)” Even though it would be hard work to find the right image on my website, I always have to think about customers first.
