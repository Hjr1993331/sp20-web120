<p>Two or three decades ago, many people believed that computers were the state-of-the-art technology at this time, so most of the people were using a computer at home or work to communicate with families, friends, and colleagues before cellphones have spread through the market. I heard that there were a large number of bugs in the old computers, so designers and developers were making an effort to create better and faster computers for all customers. As a result, people have at least one computer per household, schools, and companies. However, recently, I have seen that many people and I use smartphones to play mobile application when I walk outside because it's small and very convenient to bring outside for checking emails, making phone calls, and searching websites quickly. In contrast, computers are cumbersome and slow connection to the internet sometimes when you bring outside. Therefore, smartphones are getting more popular than computers. According to 9 advantage of mobile apps over responsive eCommerce websites, "Applications are usually 1.5 times faster than mobile websites and they perform actions much faster too. Applications store their data locally on your device…data needs to be fetched from the web servers which can take from few seconds to a minute depending upon the network speed and packet sizes (KNOWARTH Technologies)." I think it strongly agrees with the article because when I use my laptop for watching YouTube or movies, the screen frequently freezes even though Wi-Fi is working very well. I don't know what happened to my laptop, so I feel very annoying if it stops. On the other hand, when I use application in my smartphone for watching movies, it connects very quickly, and if it has a problem with the application, it uploads immediately. Therefore, I always notice that smartphone application is faster than laptop websites.
Also, smartphones are lighter than computers, so if people download many applications on your smartphone, you can use it outside even if there's no Wi-Fi. Apps or website? 10 reasons why apps better [2020] said, "mobile apps have the advantage of utilizing features of a mobile device like camera, contact list, GPS, phone calls, accelerometer, compass, etc. Such device features, when used within an app, can make the user experience interactive and fun. (Nitin)" As you can see, all smartphones include camera, GPS, and phone call when you buy it, which means that you don't have to bring a camera or compass in your bag backs anymore. Both of them have pros and cons, but I think mobile application is more convince than computer websites.
