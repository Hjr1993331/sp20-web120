<p>Although many people are supposed to use float for many years, I think Flexbox is getting more famous for developers and web designers to create new websites because Flexbox is a relatively new tag, more available inside the different browsers. It is also beneficial when you make a new website. Flexbox was publishing the first draft in 2009 in the HTML and CSS. When I searched the website, HTML was published in 1989 or 1990, so as you can see that Flexbox is relatively newer than other HTML tags. Therefore, it sounds very convenient for using a new website; however, when I saw the website called "can I use ----, "I realized that flexbox has two types of tags called "old flexbox" and "new flexbox." It said, " Only supports the old flexbox specification and does not support wrapping." I have been started learning HTML this year, so I don't need to worry about the two differences, but some web designers would be confused when you make new websites, and some websites cannot use "new flexbox."
Moreover, According to the website, "Old" Flexbox and "New" Flexbox", in CSS-TRICKS written by Chris Coyier said that "If you are looking at a blog post (or whatever) about Flexbox and you see display: box; or a property that is box-{*}, you are looking at the old 2009 version of Flexbox. If you are looking at a blog post (or whatever) about Flexbox and you see display: Flexbox; or the flex() function, you are looking at an awkward tweener phase in 2011." However, I think it can't be helped flexbox developers have changed settings because they probably didn't notice that some flexbox systems are not very useful. Therefore, they might change the system to improve the efficiency of the new one. Not only Flexbox but also other tags may be changing every year, so I thought I have to study each tag one by one.
