        <h2>Fresh</h2>
      <p>We always provide fresh vegetables, fruits, and daily foods! You should try it becuase purchasing and eating freshly-grown fruits and vegetables is the best way to ensure no preservatives, chemicals, or dyes have been added to your food. Produce actually loses its nutritional value over time, so the quicker itâ€™s eaten, the more nutrients that can be gained from it. Moreover, it tastes better!</p>

        <h2>Organics</h2>
        <p>When we make vegetables and fruits, we are always using natural fertilizers (manure, compost). It's very difficult to get rid of from pests, but we are controlled using natural methods (birds, insects, traps) and naturally-derived pesticides. Organic foods are often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their conventionally-grown counterparts and people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives often find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only organic foods. You won't regret it!</p>

        <h2>Pastured Raised</h2>
        <p>Out chickens are given at least 108 square feet each and cattle and sheep also consume some feed and lots of grass, bugs, worms and anything else they can find in the dirt. They tend to be let out of the barns early in the morning and called back in before nightfall. Therefore, if you want to eat raw eggs, you can eat our eggs, and everyone will be satisfied!</p>
